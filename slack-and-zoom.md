# How to Slack and Zoom

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is an all-in-one messaging app that many teams use today. This will be our main source of communication.

With Slack you can:
  - Send direct messages
  - Upload files
  - Download for mobile
  - lots of cool stuff


### Commonly Used Features

    - Main channel: This is where lessons take place.

### Writing Code in Slack

Slack is really handy for sharing and formatting code. Here are 3 common ways to format it in Slack:

### Single Line of Code

- That's a back tick, not an apostrophe. You can find the back-tick above the `TAB` button on your keyboard:

### Multiple Lines (Blocks)

Same as single back ticks to format code, but you wrap the whole block of code in three back-ticks.

### Code Snippet (Preferred*)

Sometimes using back-ticks messes up our code (Thanks Slack!) but you can **upload code files and snippets** by pressing the **`+`** sign in the message input field.
