# Homework
Welcome to your first homework! As we launch into bootcamp beast mode, let's make sure we're all on the same page with class expectations and the tools available to you.

Tonight's homework has 2 parts:
  1. [Student Wiki Treasure Hunt](wiki_treasure_hunt.md)
  2. [Setting up For Success](expectations.md)

Follow the instructions for both exercises. Once you are done, submit your work.

## Submitting Your Work

  When you're ready, create an issue on the class repo with
  a title in the format "First and Last Name -- Week 01 Day 01".
  The issue body should have:

  *   A link to your forked repo (ie. to your `homework` folder)
  *   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about your answers, from 1 (very
      uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
  *   A 'completeness' score, from 1 (didn't do it) to 5 (finished all of it)    
  *   A 'win'
  *   A 'struggle'
  *   A 'comment'

This is how you will be submitting your homework everyday.
